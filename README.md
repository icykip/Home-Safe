# Home-Safe
The final project to my Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques class for which I led my team in building a program that outputs the safest walking path from point A to point B, using San Francisco as a model. We use KNN to classify the risk level of a certain street based on surrounding crime, and we use UCS for our pathfinding algorithm.
